This is a simple "kitchen sink" java library that tries to file off some of the many warts of the JDK.  It works around checked exceptions, clunky IO classes, missing converters, etc.

Some classes rely on other libraries; these are documented in the class documentation.

There will not be proper releases of this code but it builds simply with ant.  Also, all APIs are subject to change.  Use at your own risk.
