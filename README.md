# unsuck

This is a simple "kitchen sink" java library that tries to file off some of the many warts of the JDK.
It works around checked exceptions, clunky IO classes, missing converters, etc.

Some classes rely on other libraries; these are documented in the class documentation.

This code is in Maven Central. However, all APIs are subject to change without notice.  Use at your own risk.
